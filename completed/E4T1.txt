# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
The SSH ports of both the 2 EC2 instances should be closed for "wide open" Internet access via editing their EC2 Security Groups where the access can be limited to specific IP addresses / CIDR ranges, or to specific Security Groups.
Both the EC2 instances should be placed inside Private Subnet(s) and be accessible only indirectly, via the Application Load Balancer.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
Assuming that the EC2 instance is still accessible via API credentials, it could be limited (via its Security Group) to be accessed only from specific IP addresses / CIDR ranges, only via specific protocols on the same 5000 port.
Additionally, the S3 buckets could be fully encrypted and even more, they could be configured to allow only Reads (GET Requests) only via so-called pre-signed URLs. In this scenario, the User should first sign-in with a 3rd party Authentication provider and only then be able to get a pre-signed URL as a Response from the S3 bucket, via which the Secret Recipes would be downloaded.
