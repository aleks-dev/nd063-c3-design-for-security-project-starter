# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
For CloudFormation IaC Templates, tools for scanning them would be 
1. CloudSploit  - https://cloudsploit.com/opensource
2. AWS CloudFormation Linter - https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint

For Terraform IaC Templates, tools for scanning them would be 
1. Chef InSpec - https://github.com/inspec/inspec
2. Regula - https://github.com/fugue/regula
3. Terrascan - https://github.com/accurics/terrascan


### Example vulnerability for infrastructure as code templates
1. Hard Coding Secrets or Resource References
2. Committing Terraform State Files into a Version Control
3. Not Performing Sanity and Security Checks Before or After Deployment
4. Using Untrusted Images or Plugins


## Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
For containers' scanning for OS vulnerabilities, some popular tools would be
1. AWS Inspector
2. Anchore (open-source) - https://anchore.com/
3. Trivy (open-source) - https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy
4. Aquasec (comercial) - https://www.aquasec.com/
5. Sysdig (comercial) - https://sysdig.com/

For AMI's scanning for OS vulnerabilities, some popular tools would be
1. AWS Inspector - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-set-up-continuous-golden-ami-vulnerability-assessments-with-amazon-inspector/
2. Digital Defense Frontline Vulnerability Manager - https://help.frontline.cloud/vm/en-us/Topics_MS/Install%20AWS%20AMI%20Scanner_AD.htm
3. Tenable Nessus - https://www.tenable.com/nessus-demo


### Example OS vulnerability in AMI or containers
1. Windows - CryptoAPI spoofing vulnerability – CVE-2020-0601
2. Windows - Remote Desktop Client Vulnerability – CVE-2020-0611
3. Linux - Kernel netfilter:xt_TCPMSS - CVE-2017-18017
4. Linux - In the Linux kernel through 5.3.2, cfg80211_mgd_wext_giwessid in net/wireless/wext-sme.c does not reject a long SSID IE, leading to a Buffer Overflow - CVE-2019-17133
5. Docker - RunC Root Access Remote Execution -  CVE-2019-5736
6. Docker - Skeleton Runtime for Apache OpenWhisk - CVE-2018-11757

## Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
1. AWS Config
2. Tenable.io - https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07J2HN7KV
3. Qualys Vulnerability Management - https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07JGH7W7V

### Example vulnerability for AWS cloud configuration
1. Misconfigured S3 buckets
2. Exposed Database Origin Servers
3. Hanging DNS Records - when an S3 bucket is deleted, many forget to remove references to it across all subdomains. This is a problem, because if a subdomain’s DNS records stay pointed to a deleted S3 bucket, an attacker can use subdomain enumeration to identify the issue and simply take over the subdomain.
