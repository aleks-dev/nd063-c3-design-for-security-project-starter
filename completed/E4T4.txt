# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Move both the EC2 instances into separate private Subnets connected with each other via Security Groups / NACLs and private VPC endpoints.
Put WAF protection in front of the App Load Balancer.
Use Route53 for "scanning" the incoming Requests, which should be only via the HTTPS protocol.
Make only the Web App instance communicate with the S3 buckets via private VPC endpoints.
Make the Secret Recipe S3 Security Group allowing incoming requests only from the Web App instance via HTTPS.
Additionaly, make the Secret Recipe S3 bucket allow only Read requests and send only pre-signed URL type of Responses.


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.



# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, for encrypting the existing S3 data an additional operation (usually a so-called Batch Encryption) needs to be called separately.


# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
