Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The Secret S3 bucket is not in a private Subnet. Even worse, it can be accessed directly from the Attack EC2 instance via API key only.
The initial configuration exposes it maximally to almost all kinds of attacks as it's accessible without requiring HTTPS/SSL for that.
On the top of this comes its content which is not being encrypted.

# Poor practice 2
The web application server is not in a private Subnet. Even worse, it can be accessed via HTTP and the public ElasticIP address, making it "wide open" to the Internet and very vulnerable.
On the top of this is the fact that its EBS volume is unencrypted.

# Poor practice 3
The Application Load Balancer is also "wide open" to the Internet by being accessed via HTTP instead of HTTPS from all possible addresses.
